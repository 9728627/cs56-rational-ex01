# cs56-rational-example

This is a set of tutorial examples of a class for Rational Numbers.  Illustrates various concepts/techinques of Java Coding (a list of these appears below.)

These examples are intended as support for a course in which there are also reading assignments and lectures; this repo is not intended to be a stand-alone curriculum for learning Java.  

Having said that, if you follow the code examples in order, and look up the concepts that are new to you at each step, that will probably go a long way towards learning some important basic concepts of Java programming.

# Basic ideas of the Rational class.

From Wikipedia (retrieved 6/13/2016): 

> In mathematics, a rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers,
> a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q.[1] Since q may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number. 
> The set of all rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface Q 
> (or blackboard bold {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } \mathbb {Q} , Unicode â„š);[2] 
> it was thus denoted in 1895 by Peano after quoziente, Italian for "quotient".

The Rational class provides an abstraction for a rational number. 
* A Rational number is a number that can be represented by 

# Guide:

* Top level directory contains 
    * this `README.md` file
    * subdirectories `ex01`, `ex02`, etc. one per example
    * support files for continuous integration (.travis.yml)
    
* To follow these examples, consult each README.md in each subdirectory (ex01/README.md) etc. in order, for further information.


# Java Language Concepts 

This is a work in progress; not all may be covered yet.  Will update this list with reference to the first example where each concept is introduced as work on this repo progresses.

1. private data members
1. public constructors, getters
1. immutable objects
1. JUnit testing
1. toString method
1. static methods (class level)
1. equals vs. == 
1. proper way to override equals and hashcode
1. exceptions (IllegalArgumentException)
1. comparable interface
1. creating an arraylist of rationals
1. sorting an arraylist of rationals

Tools

1. Compiling by hand
1. Packages
1. Ant
1. Maven
1. cyber-dojo.org  (for divisible, gcd)
