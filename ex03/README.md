In this example, we will add three new features to our build.xml file

* creating a jar file of our code
* automating testing with junit
* creating javadoc for our project

The second of those will also require a new class, RationalTest.java, a class that exists only
for the purpose of collecting test cases for all of the constructors and methods of Rational.java.

This is a practice we'll try to follow whenever developing a class
that other parts of the code rely on for correctness.  That is,
whenever possible, every class Foo.java should have a FooTest.java
that goes along with it.
